      This computes increase/decrease in cost for each given variable and corresponding
      sequence numbers which would change basis.  Sequence numbers are 0..numberColumns 
      and numberColumns.. for artificials/slacks.
      For non-basic variables the information is trivial to compute and the change in cost is just minus the 
      reduced cost and the sequence number will be that of the non-basic variables.
      For basic variables a ratio test is between the reduced costs for non-basic variables
      and the row of the tableau corresponding to the basic variable.
      The increase/decrease value is always >= 0.0

      arrays will be filled in by function.  If fifth entry in which is variable 7 then fifth entry in output arrays
      will be information for variable 7.

      If valueIncrease/Decrease not NULL (both must be NULL or both non NULL) then these are filled with
      the value of variable if such a change in cost were made (the existing bounds are ignored)
