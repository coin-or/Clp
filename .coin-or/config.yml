    Clp (*C*oin-or *l*inear *p*rogramming) is an open-source linear programming solver.
    It is primarily meant to be used as a callable library, but a basic, stand-alone executable
    version is also available. It is designed to find solutions of mathematical optimization
    problems of the form 

    minimize   c\'x
    such that  lhs &le; Ax &le; rhs
    and        lb &le; x &le; ub

    CLP includes primal and dual Simplex solvers.
    Both dual and primal algorithms can use matrix storage methods provided by the user (0-1 and 
    network matrices are already supported in addition to the default sparse matrix).
    The dual algorithm has Dantzig and Steepest edge row pivot choices; new ones may be provided 
    by the user. The same is true for the column pivot choice of the primal algorithm.
    The primal can also use a non linear cost which should work for piecewise linear convex 
    functions. CLP also includes a barrier method for solving LPs.
