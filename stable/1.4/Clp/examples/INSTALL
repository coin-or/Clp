There are a number of example/test programs in this directory. 

Before any of these sample programs could be compiled one needs to
install the COIN libraries used. This includes Clp for sure, and may
include others (like Vol). Please go to the appropriate directories,
read the INSTALL file there and install the libraries.

The examples here can be compiled by `make DRIVER=<driver>`, where
<driver> should be replaced with the name of the source file you want
to compile (without the .cpp or .c). The output of the compilation is
an executable named <driver> (or <driver>.exe on Windows).
