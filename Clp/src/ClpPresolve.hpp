      * presolve techniques are applied.

      This version of presolve returns a pointer to a new presolved
         model.  NULL if infeasible or unbounded.
         This should be paired with postsolve
         below.  The advantage of going back to original model is that it
         will be exactly as it was i.e. 0.0 will not become 1.0e-19.
         If keepIntegers is true then bounds may be tightened in
         original.  Bounds will be moved by up to feasibilityTolerance
         to try and stay feasible.
         Names will be dropped in presolved model if asked
