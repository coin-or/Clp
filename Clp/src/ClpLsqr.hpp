/**
This class implements LSQR

@verbatim
 LSQR solves  Ax = b  or  min ||b - Ax||_2  if damp = 0,
 or   min || (b)  -  (  A   )x ||   otherwise.
          || (0)     (damp I)  ||2
 A  is an m by n matrix defined by user provided routines
 matVecMult(mode, y, x)
 which performs the matrix-vector operations where y and x
 are references or pointers to CoinDenseVector objects.
 If mode = 1, matVecMult  must return  y = Ax   without altering x.
 If mode = 2, matVecMult  must return  y = A'x  without altering x.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 LSQR uses an iterative (conjugate-gradient-like) method.

 Input parameters:

 atol, btol  are stopping tolerances.  If both are 1.0e-9 (say),
             the final residual norm should be accurate to about 9 digits.
             (The final x will usually have fewer correct digits,
             depending on cond(A) and the size of damp.)
 conlim      is also a stopping tolerance.  lsqr terminates if an estimate
             of cond(A) exceeds conlim.  For compatible systems Ax = b,
             conlim could be as large as 1.0e+12 (say).  For least-squares
             problems, conlim should be less than 1.0e+8.
             Maximum precision can be obtained by setting
             atol = btol = conlim = zero, but the number of iterations
             may then be excessive.
 itnlim      is an explicit limit on iterations (for safety).
 show = 1    gives an iteration log,
 show = 0    suppresses output.
 info        is a structure special to pdco.m, used to test if
             was small enough, and continuing if necessary with smaller atol.


 Output parameters:
 x           is the final solution.
 *istop       gives the reason for termination.
 *istop       = 1 means x is an approximate solution to Ax = b.
             = 2 means x approximately solves the least-squares problem.
 rnorm       = norm(r) if damp = 0, where r = b - Ax,
             = sqrt( norm(r)**2  +  damp**2 * norm(x)**2 ) otherwise.
 xnorm       = norm(x).
 var         estimates diag( inv(A'A) ).  Omitted in this special version.
 outfo       is a structure special to pdco.m, returning information
             about whether atol had to be reduced.

 Other potential output parameters:
 anorm, acond, arnorm, xnorm
